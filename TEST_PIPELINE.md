# üöÄ PIPELINE TEST GUIDE

## ‚úÖ SETUP CONFIRMED
- GitHub environments: production & staging ‚úÖ
- Azure credentials configured ‚úÖ
- Pipeline file complete ‚úÖ

## üß™ QUICK TEST SEQUENCE

### 1. Test Staging Deployment (develop branch)
```bash
# Create test branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b test-staging-deploy

# Make visible change
echo "<!-- Staging Test $(date) -->" >> frontend/index.html

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: staging deployment verification"
git push origin test-staging-deploy

# Create PR to develop branch via GitHub UI
# Watch pipeline run - should auto-deploy to staging
```

### 2. Test Production Deployment (main branch)
```bash
# After staging test passes, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge test-staging-deploy

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Watch for manual approval prompt in GitHub Actions
# Approve deployment when prompted
```
