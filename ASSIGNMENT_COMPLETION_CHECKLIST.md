## 🎥 VIDEO DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE

Your 10-minute video should follow this EXACT sequence:

### Stage 1: Initial State
- [ ] Display currently deployed production application
- [ ] Confirm application is live and functional
- [ ] Clearly state your name

### Stage 2: Code Modification
- [ ] Make small, visible code change (e.g., modify UI text)
- [ ] Commit using Conventional Commits standard
- [ ] Push to new feature branch
- [ ] Show commit in repository

### Stage 3: Staging Deployment
- [ ] Create pull request to merge into develop branch
- [ ] While pipeline executes, explain:
  - [ ] Build process
  - [ ] Testing procedures
  - [ ] Security scanning results
- [ ] Demonstrate change on staging URL once pipeline completes

### Stage 4: Production Release
- [ ] Merge changes into main branch
- [ ] **Show manual approval step for production deployment**
- [ ] Explain monitoring dashboard and alarm configuration
- [ ] Approve the deployment

### Stage 5: Verification
- [ ] Refresh production URL to confirm live deployment
- [ ] Show updated CHANGELOG.md entry for deployed change
- [ ] Conclude with summary of successful automated deployment

##  TESTING YOUR PIPELINE

### Before Recording Video:
1. **Test the complete flow**:
   ```bash
   # Create test branch
   git checkout -b test-assignment-3
   
   # Make a visible change
   echo "<!-- Assignment 3 Test -->" >> frontend/index.html
   
   # Commit with conventional format
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add assignment 3 test marker"
   
   # Push and create PR to develop
   git push origin test-assignment-3
   ```

2. **Verify staging deployment works**
3. **Test production approval process**
4. **Confirm monitoring dashboard is accessible**

### Key Success Indicators:
- ✅ Pipeline runs without errors
- ✅ Manual approval step appears for production
- ✅ Both staging and production URLs are accessible
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard shows data
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md gets updated automatically

##  MONITORING DASHBOARD ACCESS

After deployment, access your monitoring dashboard:
- **Application Insights**: Azure Portal → Resource Groups → HerRaise_RG → herraise-insights
- **Operational Alarms**: Azure Portal → Monitor → Alerts
