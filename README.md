# HerRaise Static Website

HerRaise is a simple static website created to empower South Sudanese girls and young women through digital mentorship and community support.

## Project Aim

- Provide accessible information about mentorship opportunities.
- Bridge the digital divide and promote educational empowerment.
- Share resources, success stories, and ways to get involved.

## Technology Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration

## Automated Deployment (CI/CD)

All manual deployment steps are now automated.  
On merge to the `main` branch, the following sequence runs automatically:

1. **Code Build**: Static site files are checked and built.
2. **Automated Testing**: Basic checks and optional linting/tests.
3. **Security Scanning**: Trivy scans for vulnerabilities.
4. **Container Image Push**: Docker image is built and pushed to Azure Container Registry.
5. **Production Deployment**: Image is deployed to the live production URL.

**Production URL:**  
https://herraisehub.azurewebsites.net

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website.

az pipelines list --organization https://dev.azure.com/herraise
az pipelines build list --definition-name "herraise-cd-pipeline"

# View detailed logs
az pipelines build show --id <build-id>

# Re-run failed pipeline
az pipelines build queue --definition-name "herraise-cd-pipeline"
```

#### Azure Security Issues
```bash
# Check Azure Security Center recommendations
az security assessment list --resource-group herraise_RG

# Review container vulnerabilities
az acr repository show-vulnerabilities \
  --name herraiseacr \
  --repository herraise

# Check compliance status
az policy state list \
  --resource-group herraise-rg \
  --filter "complianceState eq 'NonCompliant'"
```

#### Azure Resource Issues
```bash
# Check Static Web App status
az staticwebapp list --query "[?contains(name, 'herraise')]"
az staticwebapp show --name herraise-prod --resource-group herraise_RG

# Verify Container Registry
az acr repository list --name herraiseacr
az acr repository show-tags --name herraiseacr --repository herraise

# Check Application Insights
az monitor app-insights component show \
  --app herraise-insights \
  --resource-group herraise_RG
```

#### Monitoring Alerts

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Production Issues**: Automated rollback triggered on health check failures
2. **Security Incidents**: Pipeline halts, alerts sent to security team
3. **Infrastructure Problems**: Terraform state rollback available
4. **Data Recovery**: Azure backup systems with point-in-time recovery


##  Known Issues & Considerations

- Inline CSS may require refactoring for larger projects
- Static content requires manual updates for each change
- Terraform state management requires secure backend (consider Azure Storage)
- Infrastructure costs should be monitored (though minimal for static sites)
