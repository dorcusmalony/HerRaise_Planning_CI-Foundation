##  Technical Architecture

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Build** - Application compilation and validation
2. **Test** - Jest unit tests and ESLint checks
3. **Security** - Multi-layer vulnerability scanning
4. **Docker** - Container build and ACR push
5. **Deploy** - Automated Azure App Service deployment
6. **Monitor** - Observability setup and configuration
7. **Validate** - Post-deployment health verification

### Security Implementation
